## Principles of Microarray Technology

Microarrays allow **simultaneous measurement of thousands of RNA transcripts** by hybridizing labeled cDNA to probes fixed on a solid surface.

- **Probes:** Short DNA sequences (~25â€“70 bp) immobilized on a glass slide or chip.
- **Hybridization:** Labeled sample cDNA binds to complementary probes.
- **Detection:** Fluorescent intensity at each spot corresponds to transcript abundance.

> In the context of microarray, a probe is a short, single-stranded DNA sequence immobilized on the array surface that specifically hybridizes to a complementary target RNA (or cDNA) sequence, enabling the detection and quantification of gene expression levels.

## One or two color arrays?

A major design consideration in a microarray experiment is whether to measure the expression levels from each sample on separate microarrays (one-colour array) or to compare relative expression levels between a pair of samples on a single microarray (two-colour array). The overall performance of one-colour and two-colour arrays is similar.

## One-Color vs Two-Color Systems

### ðŸŸ© One-Color (Single Channel)
- Each sample hybridized to its own array.
- Common in **Affymetrix** and **Illumina** platforms.
- Signal intensity represents **absolute expression** for one sample.

### ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ© Two-Color (Dual Channel)
- Two samples hybridized on the **same array**:
  - Example: Control = Cy3 (green), Treated = Cy5 (red)
- Measures **relative expression** directly by color ratio.

# Normalization

---

## Normalization method

Normalization is the process of **adjusting microarray data to remove systematic technical variation** that is not related to biological differences. Most known and used method is **RMA Normalization** (Robust Multi-array Average).

---

## RMA Normalization

**Purpose:**
To correct background noise and make expression values comparable across microarrays.

**Main Steps:**

- Background correction â€“ adjusts for optical noise and nonspecific signal.
- Quantile normalization â€“ forces all arrays to have the same overall distribution. You can possibly use only this as a normalization method.
- Summarization â€“ combines probe-level data into one expression value per gene using a median polish model.

---

## RMA Normalization

**Advantages:**

- Reduces array-to-array variability.
- Improves reproducibility in downstream differential expression analysis.
- Implemented in tools like **affy** and **oligo** (R/Bioconductor).

# Statistical analysis

---

## Fold Change in Microarray Experiments

Fold change quantifies the **magnitude of gene expression difference** between two conditions (e.g., treated vs. control).

Fold Change = Mean Expression (treated) / Mean Expression (control)

To symmetrize up- and down-regulation:
log2(Fold Change) â†’ +1 = 2Ã— up, -1 = 2Ã— down

> Fold change alone does not indicate statistical significance â€” it measures effect size only.

## p-Value and Multiple Testing

**p-value:** probability of observing a difference as extreme as the measured one, assuming no true difference (null hypothesis). In microarrays, we test thousands of genes simultaneously â†’ **many false positives by chance.**

Need multiple testing correction to control for these errors:

- Bonferroni correction: very strict, divides Î± by number of tests.
- **Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (FDR):** controls expected false discovery rate; widely used in microarray and RNA-seq.

## limma in Microarray Analysis

limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data) is one of the most widely used R packages for analyzing microarray (and RNA-seq) data. It provides a robust framework for identifying **differentially expressed genes** using linear models and empirical Bayes statistics.

## Nanostring

**Microarray:** Relies on hybridization where labeled sample nucleic acids bind to complementary sequences on a solid surface. The amount of binding is then measured by fluorescence, which is proportional to the amount of target RNA. This method requires amplification steps.

**NanoString:** Uses a direct-counting, amplification-free method. It attaches fluorescent "reporter" probes to the target nucleic acids, which are then counted directly, providing a more precise count of the original molecules.

> Both of them use same differential gene expression methods.

## Nanostring is bankruptcy

**Patent infringement lawsuit:** In November 2023, a federal jury ordered NanoString to pay competitor 10x Genomics $31 million in damages for infringing on its patents with NanoString's GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler. This loss created significant financial strain for the company.
