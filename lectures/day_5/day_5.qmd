## How much depth and reads per cell?

The required depth for RNA-seq depends on the study's goal, but a common range is **30-60 million reads per sample** for a broad view of gene expression. If you are managing to sequence 10k cells, you will probably end up with **2000-3500 read pairs per cell**.

> Not a precise equation, depends on which experiment you are designing.

# Key computational concepts

## Pre-processing

Usage of **Cell Ranger** ‚Äî the standard preprocessing software provided by **10x Genomics** ‚Äî is the first computational step in analyzing raw single-cell RNA-seq data.  
It transforms **Illumina BCL or FASTQ files** into a **gene-cell expression matrix**, which serves as the foundation for downstream analyses.

## Main steps

1) Quality control
2) Normalization
3) Feature selection
4) Dimension reduction
5) Cell annotation
6) Downstream analysis

## Main steps

## Quality control

![](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/_images/quality_control.jpeg){width=100% fig-align="center"}

## Normalization

The preprocessing step of ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù aims to adjust the raw counts in the dataset for variable sampling effects by **scaling the observable variance to a specified range**. Several normalization techniques are used in practice varying in complexity. They are mostly designed in such a way that subsequent analysis tasks and their underlying statistical methods are applicable.

## Fictional design request #1

You are working on a project that is trying to describe function of a KO in a tissue. You have 4 vs. 4 samples for each condition. You are working with a tissue with 7 known cell types. Your rarest cell type is expected to be 2% and you want to achieve at least 200 cells in all cell types.

1) How much depth should be sequenced per sample? Read pairs per cell?
2) How many cells per samples you are aiming?

# Spatial transcriptomics technologies

## What is it about? {.smaller}

Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to **quantify gene expression while preserving spatial context** within a tissue section.

- Each measurement is linked to a precise **location on the tissue**.  
- Combines **histological imaging** with **RNA sequencing** to map cellular functions in space.  
- Enables discovery of:
  - Tissue organization and cell interactions  
  - Spatial gradients in gene expression  
  - Regional responses to disease or injury  

üß† *Think of it as scRNA-seq + coordinates ‚Üí a map of molecular activity within tissues.*


## Overview {.smaller}

![](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03634-9/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3634_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp){width=100% fig-align="center"}

## Visium (10x Genomics) {.smaller}

**10x Genomics Visium** is one of the most widely used spatial transcriptomics platforms.

- Uses glass slides covered with **55 Œºm barcoded capture spots**, each containing millions of oligo-dT probes.  
- Captures mRNA directly from tissue placed on the slide, maintaining **spatial information** via spot-specific barcodes.  
- Generates paired data:
  - **Histological image** (H&E stain)  
  - **Spatial gene expression matrix**

üî¨ Resolution: ~1‚Äì10 cells per spot  
üìä Integration: Compatible with **Seurat**, **Scanpy**, and **Space Ranger** pipelines.

## Slide-seq {.smaller}

**Slide-seq** achieves higher spatial resolution using **DNA-barcoded beads**.

- A surface is coated with thousands of **10 ¬µm beads**, each with a unique positional barcode.  
- Tissue is transferred onto the bead array; mRNA diffuses and binds to nearby beads.  
- After sequencing, spatial positions are reconstructed using the known bead coordinates.  
- Enables near **single-cell resolution** across entire tissue sections.
