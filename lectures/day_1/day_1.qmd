# Quantitative RNA methods

---

## Historical Evolution Overview

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **From Northern blot ‚Üí RT-PCR ‚Üí qPCR**

A progression toward greater sensitivity, precision, and throughput

---

## Northern Blot (1977)

**Principle**: RNA separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to membrane, detected with labeled probes

**Advantages**: Northern blotting provided direct RNA visualization with valuable size information, enabling researchers to detect different isoforms of the same gene. **Limitations**: Despite its pioneering role, the method suffered from low sensitivity, requiring microgram quantities of RNA. It was also limited to analyzing one gene at a time, making it a low-throughput approach. The labor-intensive protocol could take days per experiment.

---

## Northern Blot (1977)

---

## Reverse Transcription PCR / RT-PCR (1980s) 

**Principle**: RNA ‚Üí cDNA ‚Üí PCR amplification ‚Üí endpoint detection

**Advances**: RT-PCR represented a significant leap forward with much higher sensitivity, requiring only nanogram quantities of RNA. The method was considerably faster, taking hours instead of days, and offered greater specificity through its primer-based approach, allowing targeted amplification of genes of interest. **Limitations**: However, RT-PCR relied on endpoint detection at the plateau phase of amplification, making it only semi-quantitative. Still depended on gel-based detection.

## Real-Time PCR and Karry Mullis (1983+)

---

## RT-qPCR / Real-Time PCR

<br>
<br>

**Principle**: Monitor PCR in real-time using fluorescence. Track **while** amplification occurs (Ct value), not endpoint amount.

<small>
**Advances**: qPCR revolutionized RNA quantification by achieving true quantitative precision through monitoring the exponential phase of amplification. The method boasts a wide dynamic range spanning 7-9 orders of magnitude and exceptional sensitivity capable of single-copy detection. Automation in 96 or 384-well formats dramatically increased throughput, while the closed-tube system reduced contamination risks that plagued earlier gel-based approaches.

::::

<small>
The cycle threshold (Ct) value of a reaction is defined as the cycle number when the fluorescence of a PCR product can be detected above the background signal. In order to calculate the Ct value, it is necessary to draw a horizontal line (threshold) on the amplification plot. The placement of this line is often determined by the qPCR software, however, users can manually place this line. Ideally, the threshold is placed at the point when the reaction is in the exponential phase, therefore it will not be confused with the background signal.
</small>

---

## Ct vs. Cq values

Cq (Quantification cycle) was later proposed as a standardized term by the MIQE guidelines (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments). The idea was to reduce confusion ‚Äî different instruments used ‚ÄúCt,‚Äù ‚ÄúCp,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrossing point,‚Äù etc. Ct ‚âà Cq ‚Äî they mean the same thing (the cycle at which amplification is first detected). The term Cq is just the recommended one for reporting data in publications, because it‚Äôs more general and standardized.

---

## 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt method

The 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt method is a simple way to calculate relative changes in gene expression between two samples (e.g., treated vs. control, KO vs. WT) using RT-qPCR. Our "bioinformatics" small approach to get differences in control vs. case setup.

---

## Housekeeping genes

Housekeeping genes are essential for the basic and constant functions required for a cell's survival, such as metabolism and growth. They are expected to be expressed in all cells of an organism, regardless of cell type or developmental stage, though their expression levels can vary. This makes them **valuable as reference genes in experiments like qPCR** to normalize gene expression levels between different samples. 

---

## Housekeeping genes

**Actin, beta (ACTB):** A common choice for many experiments, but not always stable.
**Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH):** Another widely used gene, though stability can vary depending on conditions.
**18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA):** Frequently used, especially for in vitro hypoxia experiments.
**Ubiquitin C (UBC):** Often used in studies, but its stability depends on the specific experimental context.
**Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1):** Used in some studies, though its expression can be unstable under certain conditions. 

---

## Formula

$$
\text{Fold change} \;=\; 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}
$$

where

$$
\Delta C_t \;=\; C_{t,\text{target}} - C_{t,\text{reference}}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\Delta\Delta C_t \;=\; \Delta C_{t,\text{sample}} - \Delta C_{t,\text{control}}.
$$

---

## Step-by-step logic

1. Normalize the target gene to a reference (housekeeping) gene:  
   $$\Delta C_t = C_t(\text{target}) - C_t(\text{reference}).$$

2. Compare the normalized values between conditions:  
   $$\Delta\Delta C_t = \Delta C_t(\text{treatment}) - \Delta C_t(\text{control}).$$

3. Compute relative expression (fold change):  
   $$\text{Relative expression} = 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}.$$

| Treated    | 22.0        | 20.5           | 1.5  | -3.5  | 11.31  |

‚Üí Interpretation: **~11-fold upregulation** of the target gene in treated samples.

| Treated    | 26.0        | 20.0           | 6.0  | 2.5   | 0.18   |

|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 28.0        | 21.0           | 7.0  | 0.0   | 1.00   |
