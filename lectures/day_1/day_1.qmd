## What is Transcriptomics?

- The **study of the complete set of RNA transcripts** produced by a genome  
- Helps reveal:
  - Which genes are active
  - How gene expression changes in different conditions
  - Insights into disease mechanisms

üß¨ *Think of transcriptomics as taking a snapshot of all active messages inside a cell.*

# Quantitative RNA methods

## Historical Evolution Overview

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **From Northern blot ‚Üí RT-PCR ‚Üí qPCR**

A progression toward greater sensitivity, precision, and throughput

---

## Northern Blot (1977)

**Principle**: RNA separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to membrane, detected with labeled probes

**Advantages**: Northern blotting provided direct RNA visualization with valuable size information, enabling researchers to detect different isoforms of the same gene. **Limitations**: Despite its pioneering role, the method suffered from low sensitivity, requiring microgram quantities of RNA. It was also limited to analyzing one gene at a time, making it a low-throughput approach. The labor-intensive protocol could take days per experiment.

---

## Northern Blot (1977)

---

## Reverse Transcription PCR / RT-PCR (1980s) 

**Principle**: RNA ‚Üí cDNA ‚Üí PCR amplification ‚Üí endpoint detection

**Advances**: RT-PCR represented a significant leap forward with much higher sensitivity, requiring only nanogram quantities of RNA. The method was considerably faster, taking hours instead of days, and offered greater specificity through its primer-based approach, allowing targeted amplification of genes of interest. **Limitations**: However, RT-PCR relied on endpoint detection at the plateau phase of amplification, making it only semi-quantitative. Still depended on gel-based detection.

## Real-Time PCR and Karry Mullis (1983)

---

## RT-qPCR / Real-Time PCR (1996s-present)

<br>
<br>

**Principle**: Monitor PCR in real-time using fluorescence. Track **while** amplification occurs (Ct value), not endpoint amount.

<small>
**Advances**: qPCR revolutionized RNA quantification by achieving true quantitative precision through monitoring the exponential phase of amplification. The method boasts a wide dynamic range spanning 7-9 orders of magnitude and exceptional sensitivity capable of single-copy detection. Automation in 96 or 384-well formats dramatically increased throughput, while the closed-tube system reduced contamination risks that plagued earlier gel-based approaches.

## 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt method

The 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt method is a simple way to calculate relative changes in gene expression between two samples (e.g., treated vs. control, KO vs. WT) using RT-qPCR. Our "bioinformatics" small approach to get differences in control vs. case setup.

---

## Formula

$$
\text{Fold change} \;=\; 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}
$$

where

$$
\Delta C_t \;=\; C_{t,\text{target}} - C_{t,\text{reference}}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\Delta\Delta C_t \;=\; \Delta C_{t,\text{sample}} - \Delta C_{t,\text{control}}.
$$

---

## Step-by-step logic

1. Normalize the target gene to a reference (housekeeping) gene:  
   $$\Delta C_t = C_t(\text{target}) - C_t(\text{reference}).$$

2. Compare the normalized values between conditions:  
   $$\Delta\Delta C_t = \Delta C_t(\text{treatment}) - \Delta C_t(\text{control}).$$

3. Compute relative expression (fold change):  
   $$\text{Relative expression} = 2^{-\Delta\Delta C_t}.$$

---

## Example

| Condition | Ct(target) | Ct(reference) | ŒîCt | ŒîŒîCt | 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 25.0        | 20.0           | 5.0  | 0.0   | 1.00   |
| Treated    | 22.0        | 20.5           | 1.5  | -3.5  | 11.31  |

‚Üí Interpretation: **~11-fold upregulation** of the target gene in treated samples.

---

## Example 2

| Condition | Ct(target) | Ct(reference) | ŒîCt | ŒîŒîCt | 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 23.0        | 19.5           | X  | X   | X   |
| Treated    | 26.0        | 20.0           | X  | X   | X   |

---

## Example 2

| Condition | Ct(target) | Ct(reference) | ŒîCt | ŒîŒîCt | 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 23.0        | 19.5           | 3.5  | 0.0   | 1.00   |
| Treated    | 26.0        | 20.0           | 6.0  | 2.5   | 0.18   |

‚Üí Interpretation: **~5.6-fold downregulation** of the target gene in treated samples.


---

## Example 3

| Condition | Ct(target) | Ct(reference) | ŒîCt | ŒîŒîCt | 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 28.0        | 21.0           | X  | X  | X   |
| Treated    | 26.5        | 20.5           | X  | X  | X   |

---

## Example 3

| Condition | Ct(target) | Ct(reference) | ŒîCt | ŒîŒîCt | 2‚ÅªŒîŒîCt |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|--------|
| Control    | 28.0        | 21.0           | 7.0  | 0.0   | 1.00   |
| Treated    | 26.5        | 20.5           | 6.0  | -1.0  | 2.00   |

‚Üí Interpretation: **~2-fold upregulation** of the target gene in treated samples.

**Abstract.** MicroRNA‚Äë137 (miR‚Äë137) has been reported to be
abnormally expressed in a variety of types of cancer, including
ovarian cancer. <...> the ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, through lentiviral transduction, puromycin selection and single‚Äëcell culture. <...> Genome editing was detected in 72% of the clones derived from sgRNA2, 4% from sgRNA3 and 0% from sgRNA1. Of the clones from sgRNA2, 32% contained 1 edited miR‚Äë137 allele and 40% contained 2 edited miR‚Äë137 alleles. **The expression of miR‚Äë137 in clones #2 and #3 could not be detected by reverse transcription‚Äë¬≠quantitative polymerase chain reaction.**
