üí° *Transcriptomics focuses on the RNA step - the bridge between genetic code and cellular action*

---

## What is Transcriptomics?

- The **study of the complete set of RNA transcripts** produced by a genome  
- Helps reveal:
  - Which genes are active
  - How gene expression changes in different conditions
  - Insights into disease mechanisms

üß¨ *Think of transcriptomics as taking a snapshot of all active messages inside a cell.*

---

## Defining the Transcriptome

### What is it?
The **complete set of transcripts** in a cell and their quantity for a specific:
- Developmental stage
- Physiological condition

### Why study it?
Essential for understanding:
- Functional elements of the genome  
- Molecular constituents of cells and tissues
- Development and disease mechanisms

---

## Key Aims of Transcriptomics

1. **Catalogue transcripts**
   - mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, small RNAs

2. **Determine gene structure**  
   - Start/end sites, splicing patterns, modifications

3. **Quantify expression changes**
   - During development and different conditions

---

## Why Transcriptomics Matters

- Understanding **cell identity** and **response to stimuli**
- Applications in:
  - Disease diagnosis and progression
  - Drug discovery
  - Functional genomics

## Daily Activities Explained

Each day you will:

1. Learn the theory and logic behind a specific analysis step  
2. Work on **a real research scenario** inspired by published studies  
3. Prepare a short presentation proposing **your analytical strategy**  

üéØ *Goal:* Learn by applying ‚Äî not just by coding.

---

## Today's Goals

By the end of today, you should be able to:

- Define transcriptomics and describe its scope  
- Identify common types of RNA-seq studies  
- Understand the flow of data from sequencing to biological insight  
- Know how the rest of the lecture will unfold

---

## Discussion Prompt

üí¨ **Question:**  
> ‚ÄúIf you had to explain transcriptomics to a high school student, how would you do it?‚Äù

Take 3 minutes with your group, then share your best analogy.
