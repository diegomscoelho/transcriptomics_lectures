üí° *Transcriptomics focuses on the RNA step - the bridge between genetic code and cellular action*

---

## What is Transcriptomics?

- The **study of the complete set of RNA transcripts** produced by a genome  
- Helps reveal:
  - Which genes are active
  - How gene expression changes in different conditions
  - Insights into disease mechanisms

üß¨ *Think of transcriptomics as taking a snapshot of all active messages inside a cell.*

## Defining the Transcriptome

### What is it?
The **complete set of transcripts** in a cell and their quantity for a specific:
- Developmental stage
- Physiological condition

### Why study it?
Essential for understanding:
- Functional elements of the genome  
- Molecular constituents of cells and tissues
- Development and disease mechanisms

---

## Key Aims of Transcriptomics

1. **Catalogue transcripts**
   - mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, small RNAs

2. **Determine gene structure**  
   - Start/end sites, splicing patterns, modifications

3. **Quantify expression changes**
   - During development and different conditions

---

## Why Transcriptomics Matters

- Understanding **cell identity** and **response to stimuli**
- Applications in:
  - Disease diagnosis and progression
  - Drug discovery
  - Functional genomics

# 2. Historical Evolution of RNA Quantification

## Historical Evolution Overview

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **From Northern blot ‚Üí RT-PCR ‚Üí qPCR**

A progression toward greater sensitivity, precision, and throughput

---

## Northern Blot (1977)

**Principle**: RNA separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to membrane, detected with labeled probes

**Advantages**: Northern blotting provided direct RNA visualization with valuable size information, enabling researchers to detect different isoforms of the same gene. **Limitations**: Despite its pioneering role, the method suffered from low sensitivity, requiring microgram quantities of RNA. It was also limited to analyzing one gene at a time, making it a low-throughput approach. The labor-intensive protocol could take days per experiment.

## Northern Blot (1977)

---

## RT-PCR (1980s)

**Principle**: RNA ‚Üí cDNA ‚Üí PCR amplification ‚Üí endpoint detection

**Advances**: RT-PCR represented a significant leap forward with much higher sensitivity, requiring only nanogram quantities of RNA. The method was considerably faster, taking hours instead of days, and offered greater specificity through its primer-based approach, allowing targeted amplification of genes of interest. **Limitations**: However, RT-PCR relied on endpoint detection at the plateau phase of amplification, making it only semi-quantitative. Still depended on gel-based detection.

## RT-qPCR / Real-Time PCR (1990s-present)

<br>
<br>

**Principle**: Monitor PCR in real-time using fluorescence. Track **while** amplification occurs (Ct value), not endpoint amount.

<small>
**Advances**: qPCR revolutionized RNA quantification by achieving true quantitative precision through monitoring the exponential phase of amplification. The method boasts a wide dynamic range spanning 7-9 orders of magnitude and exceptional sensitivity capable of single-copy detection. Automation in 96 or 384-well formats dramatically increased throughput, while the closed-tube system reduced contamination risks that plagued earlier gel-based approaches.

**Abstract.** MicroRNA‚Äë137 (miR‚Äë137) has been reported to be
abnormally expressed in a variety of types of cancer, including
ovarian cancer. <...> the ovarian cancer cell line, A2780, through lentiviral transduction, puromycin selection and single‚Äëcell culture. <...> Genome editing was detected in 72% of the clones derived from sgRNA2, 4% from sgRNA3 and 0% from sgRNA1. Of the clones from sgRNA2, 32% contained 1 edited miR‚Äë137 allele and 40% contained 2 edited miR‚Äë137 alleles. **The expression of miR‚Äë137 in clones #2 and #3 could not be detected by reverse transcription‚Äë¬≠quantitative polymerase chain reaction.**
